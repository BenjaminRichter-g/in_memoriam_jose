I feel lucky to have been in his class and grown up with him, from being just 10 year olds all the way up until graduation, and then living simultaneously in Paris for a few years. He was always a supportive friend especially when it came to my singing, cheering me on and showing up to several of my gigs during that time.

Our Parisian strolls, the sleepovers and our metaphysical discussions, from the existence of god to “can we truly love one person ?” with occasional ping-pongs and hip hop detours. Two firey and stubborn “North Africans” trying to have the last word but also looking for a place where we belong. But beyond all of that, you always made it a point to make others feel good about themselves and who they are. I loved your smile, the honesty of your voice and thoughts, your deep and curious intelligence, all the love you had to give (yes, indeed), your incredible connection with little humans who are far better than the bigger ones. I will forever cherish our time and will smile, ear to ear just like you, every-time I walk on rue de Turenne. Infinite love and light. Farah aka Faroushki",

José, Piski, Cookies, Fuity, Quicky, todos estos nombres distintos que llamaban a la misma persona. Una persona inteligente, cariñosa, abierta, con un sentido del humor que no tenía límite. Compartíamos una pasión por África del Oeste, con su obsesión por los datos y mapas de conflicto y desplazados. José Luengo Cabrera, este nombre que todavía es famoso en mi sector. Tenía tanto potencial para tener la vida de sus sueños, en París, trabajando para la OCDE, con 4 hijos y probablemente más de una mamita.

Abrazarte y poner la cabeza en tu pecho era un lugar seguro y reconfortante. Siempre estabas, desde cualquier lugar del mundo o momento del día. Eras capaz de ver y sacar lo bueno de cada persona. Unías a la gente. Hubieses llegado a liderar Naciones unidas, no tengo duda, y ahí hubieses unido naciones, como nos has unido a tantas personas. Ahora has creado una comunidad que se quedará unida por ti para siempre. Me reconforta pensar que quizás es esa comunidad la que te alargó la vida. Espero que tu alma haya encontrado paz, no sé si nosotros lleguemos a encontrarla, pero hay un poco de Piski en nuestros corazones, de tu forma de ver el mundo y la vida. Te quiero amigo, gracias por ver en mi siempre luz, y sacármela hasta cuando tú no encontrabas la tuya. Te llevo en mi corazón, en mi forma de pensar, de ser, de querer, y de vivir. Cuidaremos de tu madre.",

Fast forward and our paths crossed again, over in Sydney where our friendship was rekindled, and we enjoyed many a meal, hike, weekend away and cookies…and you’d sleep in the sunshine whilst I swam in the sea. I could only get you in there once due to your fear of sharks in Australia. It was ever so hard to be in the same place as you thereafter, but a couple of London meets, and you idolising my children, filled my heart enough. Your smile lit up a room, and I’ve never known anyone who could be so silly, yet so hyper intelligent and intellectual at the switch of a button. Your warmth, generosity, loyalty, humour, openness and playfulness is what touches so many, in all corners of the globe that you’ve at one time called home. Your network is so vast, but you’ve often been the common thread that has linked me with others. The world was better because of you. Because of your love and your heart, because you were so good inside, and I’m going to miss this so dearly. It feels like eternity ago to be young and stupid with little agenda together and the years have rolled on…but not by enough. I will tell your nephew and niece (as you referred my kids) all about you, and if I can provide them as much love, and laughs as you gave others, I think I’ll be doing just fine. Rest easy my brother, I love you. Burny",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

    "description": "I always thought of José as the cool kid—always surrounded by friends, always laughing, effortlessly fitting in with the older crowd at school. But behind that easy charm was someone incredibly dedicated and driven. He was a top student, and I remember when he self-imposed a friendly competition over our grades. I relished those moments when I’d score just one percent higher! And yet he was never too proud to ask for help with tricky math homework.",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

Immediately he decided we were to get married and started calling me moglieeeeee with the biggest smile...at 10 or 11 yo. I went along, as I was instantly drawn to him, his charm was disarming and his light so bright, he naturally made you feel at ease and was your biggest supporter no matter what. From then on, we called each other marito e moglie and shared so much affection, banter, laughs until the bac. He always supported me when I needed it, listened to me for hours in avenue château de Walzin.",

I remember thinking to myself how exceptional that was and have admired him since then.  His charisma and boldness were already inspiring then, when we were but teenagers, and I am sure he has inspired many more since then. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. Isadora",

I went along, as I was instantly drawn to him, his charm was disarming and his light so bright, he naturally made you feel at ease and was your biggest supporter no matter what. From then on, we called each other marito e moglie and shared so much affection, banter, laughs until the bac.

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

Most of all, I remember the moment I realized how brilliant he was: it was a normal morning in the school’s cafeteria, and while my friends and I were queuing to buy a couque au chocolat, José was organizing a fundraiser for an NGO where he planned to volunteer during the summer. I remember thinking to myself how exceptional that was and have admired him since then.  His charisma and boldness were already inspiring then, when we were but teenagers, and I am sure he has inspired many more since then. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. Isadora",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

I relished those moments when I’d score just one percent higher! And yet he was never too proud to ask for help with tricky math homework.",

He met my children in January, and left a huge impression on them - playing with them on the beach, and chasing them around the pool. They talked about him for months afterwards. I am still struggling to process what has happened. It has made me more determined to check in on friends who I think may be struggling. Jose was a wonderful person who left a positive imprint on the world.",

I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive.
