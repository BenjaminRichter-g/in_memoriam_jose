He had the brightest smile, an amazing laugh and gave the best bear hugs. And his Ali G quotes still make me laugh to this day! I feel lucky to have been in his class and grown up with him, from being just 10 year olds all the way up until graduation, and then living simultaneously in Paris for a few years. He was always a supportive friend especially when it came to my singing, cheering me on and showing up to several of my gigs during that time. There are so many memories from school and beyond that I will always cherish. José you were a great friend and a great human. I’ll miss you dearly ❤️ Charlotte/Lottie",

Our Parisian strolls, the sleepovers and our metaphysical discussions, from the existence of god to “can we truly love one person ?” with occasional ping-pongs and hip hop detours. Two firey and stubborn “North Africans” trying to have the last word but also looking for a place where we belong. But beyond all of that, you always made it a point to make others feel good about themselves and who they are. I loved your smile, the honesty of your voice and thoughts, your deep and curious intelligence, all the love you had to give (yes, indeed), your incredible connection with little humans who are far better than the bigger ones. I will forever cherish our time and will smile, ear to ear just like you, every-time I walk on rue de Turenne. Infinite love and light. Farah aka Faroushki",

El 28 de junio de 2025, me estaba preparando para volver a mi casa en Dakar, donde compartimos tantas risas el y yo hace un par de años. El 28 de junio de 2025, me llamaron para anunciarme que se había ido… Mis manos temblando no me lo podía creer. José, Piski, Cookies, Fuity, Quicky, todos estos nombres distintos que llamaban a la misma persona. Una persona inteligente, cariñosa, abierta, con un sentido del humor que no tenía límite. Compartíamos una pasión por África del Oeste, con su obsesión por los datos y mapas de conflicto y desplazados. José Luengo Cabrera, este nombre que todavía es famoso en mi sector. Tenía tanto potencial para tener la vida de sus sueños, en París, trabajando para la OCDE, con 4 hijos y probablemente más de una mamita. Pero su salud mental tomó demasiado espacio y, al final, ganó ella. Que descanses, amigo mío, ahora no sufrirás más. Tu presencia se queda aquí porque viviras siempre en nuestros corazones.",

At school, we were not particularly close, but in the same class at EE school, for all of secondary, meant something that bonds us all. You were always someone who I admired from a distance, most probably due to you being too 'cool' for me and so good-looking! I remember distinctly beeing invited to your 18th birthday party before our Baccalaureate and loosing my voice as I was singing and shouting and felt honoured to be there and felt so cool to have been part of that day. Rest in Peace José. Love, Hetta xx",

You seemed to be doing well, excited for Christmas and happy with a quieter pace in Tenerife. I never imagined anything like this could happen to you. You always spoke about wanting kids - and would have made a great/modern/woke dad. You made an impact on so many people and had so many friends. Everyone loved you. It's a real loss for all of us. Everyone wondering what we could have done to help sooner. Thank you for saving me that one time my aunt's car broke down and for introducing me to Adrian - you always took credit for that :). I'll never forget our fun times in uni with everyone and I'll never forget you. Rest in peace, all my love and condolences to your mom and family <3",

    "description": "“It’s like an oven in there”. He’ll know what that means. I remember when neither of us could remember the English word for cinnamon. And when we hired the velib bikes and he didn’t realise you paid by the hour and put it in his apartment overnight claiming he’d joined the green revolution. “Does trimming count?” He’ll know what to at one means too. One of the best years of my life was punctuated by his fizzy and fabulous energy. 16 wonderful years of friendship with a true individual and a singularly generous and kind soul. You cared for me when I needed it and you opened my world to so many new experiences. I will miss you José. And that infectious smile. You lit up every room you entered. You are one in a million. Sometimes the brightest bulbs burn out the fastest. Your footprints remain on my heart. Love always xxx",

Abrazarte y poner la cabeza en tu pecho era un lugar seguro y reconfortante. Siempre estabas, desde cualquier lugar del mundo o momento del día. Eras capaz de ver y sacar lo bueno de cada persona. Unías a la gente. Hubieses llegado a liderar Naciones unidas, no tengo duda, y ahí hubieses unido naciones, como nos has unido a tantas personas. Ahora has creado una comunidad que se quedará unida por ti para siempre. Me reconforta pensar que quizás es esa comunidad la que te alargó la vida. Espero que tu alma haya encontrado paz, no sé si nosotros lleguemos a encontrarla, pero hay un poco de Piski en nuestros corazones, de tu forma de ver el mundo y la vida. Te quiero amigo, gracias por ver en mi siempre luz, y sacármela hasta cuando tú no encontrabas la tuya. Te llevo en mi corazón, en mi forma de pensar, de ser, de querer, y de vivir.

    "description": "José, it’s Burny. We were fortunate enough to meet all those years ago back at Warwick, living young and free lives and thick as thieves, especially in final year. Fast forward and our paths crossed again, over in Sydney where our friendship was rekindled, and we enjoyed many a meal, hike, weekend away and cookies…and you’d sleep in the sunshine whilst I swam in the sea. I could only get you in there once due to your fear of sharks in Australia. It was ever so hard to be in the same place as you thereafter, but a couple of London meets, and you idolising my children, filled my heart enough. Your smile lit up a room, and I’ve never known anyone who could be so silly, yet so hyper intelligent and intellectual at the switch of a button. Your warmth, generosity, loyalty, humour, openness and playfulness is what touches so many, in all corners of the globe that you’ve at one time called home. Your network is so vast, but you’ve often been the common thread that has linked me with others. The world was better because of you. Because of your love and your heart, because you were so good inside, and I’m going to miss this so dearly. It feels like eternity ago to be young and stupid with little agenda together and the years have rolled on…but not by enough. I will tell your nephew and niece (as you referred my kids) all about you, and if I can provide them as much love, and laughs as you gave others, I think I’ll be doing just fine. Rest easy my brother, I love you. Burny",
