He had the brightest smile, an amazing laugh and gave the best bear hugs. And his Ali G quotes still make me laugh to this day! I feel lucky to have been in his class and grown up with him, from being just 10 year olds all the way up until graduation, and then living simultaneously in Paris for a few years. He was always a supportive friend especially when it came to my singing, cheering me on and showing up to several of my gigs during that time. There are so many memories from school and beyond that I will always cherish. José you were a great friend and a great human. I’ll miss you dearly ❤️ Charlotte/Lottie",

Our Parisian strolls, the sleepovers and our metaphysical discussions, from the existence of god to “can we truly love one person ?” with occasional ping-pongs and hip hop detours. Two firey and stubborn “North Africans” trying to have the last word but also looking for a place where we belong. But beyond all of that, you always made it a point to make others feel good about themselves and who they are. I loved your smile, the honesty of your voice and thoughts, your deep and curious intelligence, all the love you had to give (yes, indeed), your incredible connection with little humans who are far better than the bigger ones. I will forever cherish our time and will smile, ear to ear just like you, every-time I walk on rue de Turenne. Infinite love and light. Farah aka Faroushki",

El 28 de junio de 2025, me estaba preparando para volver a mi casa en Dakar, donde compartimos tantas risas el y yo hace un par de años. El 28 de junio de 2025, me llamaron para anunciarme que se había ido… Mis manos temblando no me lo podía creer. José, Piski, Cookies, Fuity, Quicky, todos estos nombres distintos que llamaban a la misma persona. Una persona inteligente, cariñosa, abierta, con un sentido del humor que no tenía límite. Compartíamos una pasión por África del Oeste, con su obsesión por los datos y mapas de conflicto y desplazados. José Luengo Cabrera, este nombre que todavía es famoso en mi sector. Tenía tanto potencial para tener la vida de sus sueños, en París, trabajando para la OCDE, con 4 hijos y probablemente más de una mamita. Pero su salud mental tomó demasiado espacio y, al final, ganó ella. Que descanses, amigo mío, ahora no sufrirás más. Tu presencia se queda aquí porque viviras siempre en nuestros corazones.",

You seemed to be doing well, excited for Christmas and happy with a quieter pace in Tenerife. I never imagined anything like this could happen to you. You always spoke about wanting kids - and would have made a great/modern/woke dad. You made an impact on so many people and had so many friends. Everyone loved you. It's a real loss for all of us. Everyone wondering what we could have done to help sooner. Thank you for saving me that one time my aunt's car broke down and for introducing me to Adrian - you always took credit for that :). I'll never forget our fun times in uni with everyone and I'll never forget you. Rest in peace, all my love and condolences to your mom and family <3",

You cared for me when I needed it and you opened my world to so many new experiences. I will miss you José. And that infectious smile. You lit up every room you entered. You are one in a million.

Ahora has creado una comunidad que se quedará unida por ti para siempre. Me reconforta pensar que quizás es esa comunidad la que te alargó la vida.

Fast forward and our paths crossed again, over in Sydney where our friendship was rekindled, and we enjoyed many a meal, hike, weekend away and cookies…and you’d sleep in the sunshine whilst I swam in the sea. I could only get you in there once due to your fear of sharks in Australia. It was ever so hard to be in the same place as you thereafter, but a couple of London meets, and you idolising my children, filled my heart enough. Your smile lit up a room, and I’ve never known anyone who could be so silly, yet so hyper intelligent and intellectual at the switch of a button. Your warmth, generosity, loyalty, humour, openness and playfulness is what touches so many, in all corners of the globe that you’ve at one time called home. Your network is so vast, but you’ve often been the common thread that has linked me with others. The world was better because of you. Because of your love and your heart, because you were so good inside, and I’m going to miss this so dearly. It feels like eternity ago to be young and stupid with little agenda together and the years have rolled on…but not by enough. I will tell your nephew and niece (as you referred my kids) all about you, and if I can provide them as much love, and laughs as you gave others, I think I’ll be doing just fine. Rest easy my brother, I love you. Burny",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

We had some wonderful moments at university, and he was a great friend to me - my time at Warwick was richer as a result of his friendship. He met my children in January, and left a huge impression on them - playing with them on the beach, and chasing them around the pool. They talked about him for months afterwards. I am still struggling to process what has happened. It has made me more determined to check in on friends who I think may be struggling.

We had some wonderful moments at university, and he was a great friend to me - my time at Warwick was richer as a result of his friendship. He met my children in January, and left a huge impression on them - playing with them on the beach, and chasing them around the pool. They talked about him for months afterwards. I am still struggling to process what has happened. It has made me more determined to check in on friends who I think may be struggling. Jose was a wonderful person who left a positive imprint on the world.",

I remember thinking to myself how exceptional that was and have admired him since then.  His charisma and boldness were already inspiring then, when we were but teenagers, and I am sure he has inspired many more since then. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. Isadora",

You were always someone who I admired from a distance, most probably due to you being too 'cool' for me and so good-looking!

I still can't fathom that this happened and I wish I had understood your sufferings better so I could have been there for you more. I hope you have found peace and that you're as well surrounded now as you were throughout your amazing life. I'll never forget the times we spent together. Love you forever, rest well. ..Tom Berg",

At school, we were not particularly close, but in the same class at EE school, for all of secondary, meant something that bonds us all. You were always someone who I admired from a distance, most probably due to you being too 'cool' for me and so good-looking! I remember distinctly beeing invited to your 18th birthday party before our Baccalaureate and loosing my voice as I was singing and shouting and felt honoured to be there and felt so cool to have been part of that day. Rest in Peace José. Love, Hetta xx",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

At school, we were not particularly close, but in the same class at EE school, for all of secondary, meant something that bonds us all. You were always someone who I admired from a distance, most probably due to you being too 'cool' for me and so good-looking!

It’s heartbreaking to know of the pain he was going through behind that kind, brave face we knew and loved. His energy and positivity lifted everywhere he graced and everyone he met. We are lucky to have known him and to have had him in our lives. I hope his family and those closest to him can find some solace from knowing how many people José touched and inspired. You will be sorely missed. Rest in peace brother",

He was so good to me and just a ray of sunshine in my life especially in my school days. That’s how I’ll remember him. We connected over basketball too. More recently we’d go back and forth in messages about the NBA. The last message being a comment on my post about LeBron and Luka playing together in March of this year. Little messages that kept our friendship alive are now even more precious to me. The photo I’m sharing is from when we spent Thanksgiving together in 2014 in Paris with some other friends from school",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

He met my children in January, and left a huge impression on them - playing with them on the beach, and chasing them around the pool. They talked about him for months afterwards. I am still struggling to process what has happened. It has made me more determined to check in on friends who I think may be struggling.
