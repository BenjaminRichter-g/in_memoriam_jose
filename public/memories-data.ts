    "description": "- Jos√© -\nFiery, intelligent, and sharp‚Äîa brilliant mind and an even brighter soul. But above all, he was present. He truly listened. He was the kind of friend who offered clarity, comfort, and candor all at once‚Äîa rare soundboard who met you where you were, with heart and honesty.\n\nOur friendship transcended borders and time zones. It was rooted in love‚Äîdeep, unwavering, and generously shared. That love flowed towards my children, Ayana and Nnamdi, his proud godchildren. Jos√© wasn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúUncle,‚Äù he was THE Uncle‚Äîwarm, playful, and unforgettable. \"That song with Uncle in his car,\" Ayana still says about Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs Bed Chem‚Äîthe tune forever etched in her memory, tied to his laughter and that joy-filled ride.\n\nI think of you daily, Jos√©. Your favorite cereal still sits in our kitchen. The Nesquik waits for your next visit. The kids‚Äô swimming and tennis milestones still feel like part of a bigger journey‚Äîtoward Tenerife... Our discussions about Lapland in 2026 to meet Father Christmas, or wherever our next grand adventure with you might‚Äôve been.\n\nYou are missed beyond words, but your place in our hearts is eternal.\n\nWith love,",

You didn‚Äôt even notice.\nThat was a few months before we ever spoke, but I already liked you so much by then.\n\nA few days ago, I went back to my parents‚Äô house and found that ball again, tucked away\nin an old memory box.‚Ä®I had kept it all these years.‚Ä®It reminds me of something good.\nA time in our lives when we were small, and everything felt so light.\n\nIn that same box, inside a middle school diary, I also found this photo you once gave me.\nIt brought back your amazing Hugo Boss scent, and that iconic little white necklace\nof yours.‚Ä®We were just kids.\n\nYou had the most contagious smile.‚Ä®I still can‚Äôt believe this has happened.\n\nI'm holding your mother in my thoughts.‚Ä®She used to chat with mine outside school.\nMy mother remembers her fondly and, like me, sends her a warm and loving embrace.\nFor what it‚Äôs worth, she had an extraordinary son.\nI hope she can feel how many people are holding her close right now, even in silence.",

No words were exchanged just silence as we watched a movie and I don't even recall how we got there. That stuck with me because it's as though you recognised sadness when you saw it. You hugged me and showed me you were there with me in that moment.\n\nThen throughout the years we stayed in touch and you attended my wedding and danced with me in one of my happiest moments. \nYou naturally knew how to celebrate someone in their highs & how to comfort them in their lows. \nYour warm energy, your magnetic personality, your beautiful mind, your radiant smile, your big heart full of love ready to give and offer anyone who needed it is something we will never forget. \n\nMay God rest your beautiful soul in peace.\n\nRest easy, friend xxx",

Always up to do anything (whatever the time and place), always so generous of your time, attentions and cuddles. I love the times we had together in NYC with our group in festivals, parties and anywhere we found cool. What an amazing time we also spent in your hometown, Canaries. You made us travel everywhere in this big red van, meet all of your friends (=the entire city) and we felt so well in your house with your family. Felt like home. I will always remember this New Year‚Äôs Eve at your parent‚Äôs table eating ¬´¬†las uvas¬†¬ª so quickly !\nEven leaving far away these last years, I was so touched that you to came to our wedding in the middle of nowhere in the desert. \nAlways here for your friends. \nYou were the friend of everyone and everyone loves you so much. \nJos√©, the best, forever.",

He had the brightest smile, an amazing laugh and gave the best bear hugs. And his Ali G quotes still make me laugh to this day! I feel lucky to have been in his class and grown up with him, from being just 10 year olds all the way up until graduation, and then living simultaneously in Paris for a few years. He was always a supportive friend especially when it came to my singing, cheering me on and showing up to several of my gigs during that time.

    "description": "Jos√© and I met in the French class of Madame Dezy in 98‚Äô or 99 and were desk mates for a good 5 or 6 years. Immediately he decided we were to \"get married\" and started calling me \"moglieeeeee\" with the biggest smile...at 10 or 11 yo. I went along, as I was instantly drawn to him, his charm was disarming and his light so bright, he naturally made you feel at ease and was your biggest supporter no matter what. From then on, we called each other \"marito e moglie\" and shared so much affection, banter, laughs until the bac. He always supported me when I needed it, listened to me for hours in avenue ch√¢teau de Walzin.\n\nJos√© was bigger than life, undoubtedly one of the brightest souls I've ever met. He had this aura of someone who was set to do things for others from an early age. He never took himself too seriously and cared deeply. \n\nEven if we lost touch in recent years, I will always cherish his memory. I will never forget his laugh, I can still hear his \"la baaaaaarbe\" shouted in random moments, his smile, his all-year tan, but also his ability to comfort others and to celebrate.\nJozy, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love you have given all of us, you managed to bring people together in this heartache. \nIt breaks my heart that you were hurting so much and I had no idea.\nAs I try to wrap my mind about what led you to this final act, I pray that you have found peace at last. My thoughts go to your family. \nTua \"moglie\", Chiara",

Most of all, I remember the moment I realized how brilliant he was: it was a normal morning in the school‚Äôs cafeteria, and while my friends and I were queuing to buy a couque au chocolat, Jos√© was organizing a fundraiser for an NGO where he planned to volunteer during the summer. I remember thinking to myself how exceptional that was and have admired him since then.  His charisma and boldness were already inspiring then, when we were but teenagers, and I am sure he has inspired many more since then. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. Isadora",

I am overcome with emotion knowing you are no longer here, but I take some comfort in knowing you chose your own path.\n\nFirst‚Äîthank you. Thank you for the memories and the lasting impact you made on me. When I think of you, I picture that carefree (or at least, carefree-seeming) guy who was always ready with a hug, deeply affectionate, who made everything look so easy and who never pulled up his pants (!). We were always quietly competitive‚Äîbut what was the point? You always seemed better at everything: from history to swimming, to dancing, to making friends. And yet, you were always the hardest to read, with so much going on beneath the surface. I was always encouraging you to let it out, to share.\n\nEven now, it‚Äôs no surprise to me that even in your final act, you‚Äôve managed to connect people from all over the world‚Äîyour reach seems to have had no bounds. I will carry you with me always.\n\nTo your parents‚Äî\nI want to express my deepest condolences, knowing there can be no greater pain than outliving your child. Please know that you were extraordinary parents to him. Jos√©‚Äôs love for you was deep, proud and loud‚Äîhe carried it everywhere he went. I will always remember your kindness. You spoke to me as a person, not just a kid, and that has stayed with me all these years.\n\nWith all my heart,\nJessie",

    "description": "I can‚Äôt quite remember the first time I saw him, but immediately I was drawn to him. Who‚Äôs that Spanish kid with the great hair and tan?! Even as a kid he had an effortless charm about him.  I thought about taking up tennis so I‚Äôd have more to talk to him about‚Ä¶ \n\nI don‚Äôt have many people still in my life from the time I was 7 years old, but Jos√© was one of them. Despite the number of years (hard to believe it‚Äôs been 30) and various places we both lived, somehow we always managed to stay in touch. That was one of his many talents, connecting with people. He had that way about him, a fun-loving and carefree spirit that just attracted people to him. Make no mistake, the sincerity with which he took friendship meant that once you were in, you were in - a guaranteed friend for life.\n\nWhen he reached out to me just before Christmas to say he was in Ireland I didn‚Äôt hesitate to meet up with him in Dublin. He bounded in the door wearing a Guinness sweatshirt for the occasion, and propped himself up at the bar with a pint to match his sweatshirt. Blending right in with the locals. Not. He was born to stand out. We laughed and laughed - it was like no time had passed. I‚Äôm so grateful to have had that last memory with him.\n\nThat warm, smiling face is how I will always remember you Jos√©. Rest in peace my friend, you will be so missed.",

Two firey and stubborn ‚ÄúNorth Africans‚Äù trying to have the last word but also looking for a place where we belong.

    "description": "We met on the way to an active volcano, and there isn‚Äôt a single friend who hasn‚Äôt heard this story from me. Me, the reckless brazilian who believed in coincidences, and who loved the thrill of going on a trip with someone I barely knew. You, charming and full of opinions and ideas, who couldn‚Äôt stop talking, mixing five languages at once, and doing everything you could to make sure I was having the best time of my life. And just like that, I knew you were one of a kind.\n\nIt was your favourite place on earth, and it became one of mine too. We drove for hours as the vegetation changed like I was arriving on another planet. The air thinned, and maybe that‚Äôs why everything felt so breathtaking. You took me to a desert, to a volcano, and later, no exaggeration, to the moon. \n\nThe night fell and I realised I had never been so close to complete darkness. That‚Äôs when you told me to look for the light in the form of shooting stars. And there they were, falling, shining, while I trembled from the sudden cold, yes, but also from the realisation that the universe was revealing its magic right in front of me. You stared at me and held me. In that moment, all I knew is that life is meant to be lived to its fullest.\n\nNothing about either of us was straightforward, nor was the connection we built over the years. I admired your intelligence, but was often bothered by your challenging statements. I appreciated your affection, but often ran away from it. We had fundamental differences in how we looked at life‚Ä¶ and yet, such similar ways of living it.\n\nYou were one of those rare ones who take action and show up, this time to visit me in my favourite place. Nothing had changed: being with you still felt like a strange definition of home. Again, it wasn‚Äôt simple. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had many people in life look at me the way you always did. With genuine care. With sustained affection. With the presence of someone who stays, no matter what. The kind of look that makes your existence feel like a gift. We said goodbye with plans for Carnival and many more. I wish I‚Äôd known it was the last time. The way you called me bichacha still echoes in my head.\n\nTe quiero much√≠simo. Desde ac√°, seguir√© buscando m√°s shooting stars - s√© que ser√°n tu manera de llamarme ‚Äúbichacha‚Äù a la distancia. Gracias por haber iluminado este mundo.",

Ten√≠a tanto potencial para tener la vida de sus sue√±os, en Par√≠s, trabajando para la OCDE, con 4 hijos y probablemente m√°s de una mamita. Pero su salud mental tom√≥ demasiado espacio y, al final, gan√≥ ella. Que descanses, amigo m√≠o, ahora no sufrir√°s m√°s. Tu presencia se queda aqu√≠ porque viviras siempre en nuestros corazones.",

    "description": "Jose was, and always will be a force to reckon with. Amidst everything that goes on in the world and all the types of people we have met, Jose stood out as one of the most purest souls I‚Äôve met. His childlike approach to people meant that he would speak to everyone with no inhibitions, no presumptions, no judgement, just pure, open, warm and welcoming. \n\nHe was the smiley face in Arthur Vick that we would see everytime we would come back from class. He brightened up every room, and he had a demeanor that could make anyone feel loved and welcomed. He had a curiosity and fervor for life that was admirable. \n\nI still remember when my family came to Warwick, he barged into the room, with a big hug, introduced himself, all smiles, and my family was in awe at the warmth and familiarity with which he met them. Since then they remember him. \n\nWhen I was going to get married, I was so fortunate that my fianc√© got to meet him - he was so excited to meet him, despite us not having spoken for so long. Not time, nor a lack of communication, nothing could stop Jose from showing love and pure warmth from start to end, and just being the naive, almost innocent, child that he is deep down inside. \n\nWe spoke at length about meeting again, and it saddens me that he never got to meet my children, or rather they didnt have the privilege of meeting him. But his soul is in our hearts, we will cherish the moments, his smile and the beautiful aura that surrounded him; it can never be forgotten. \n\nRest in peace Jose, we know you‚Äôre always around. Thank you for all that you taught us. Thank you for being you. And thank you for touching our lives, albeit briefly, but enough for us to remember forever.",

You would light up a room when you entered it. You always did that for me when you entered the apartment‚Ä¶\nI remember crying my eyes out when I left Sydney which meant that our time as flatmates and as the musical duo ‚ÄúPink Marble & Gold‚Äù had come to an end. But that was nothing compared to how heavy this loss weighs on me now. Losing you is truly tragic for so many people, which only shows how many peoples‚Äô hearts you have touched and left a forever-lasting mark on. You have passed away way too early and it breaks my heart knowing how much you struggled these past few years. I miss you so much and I hope you find peace. I love you, brother!\nHenning",

At school, we were not particularly close, but in the same class at EE school, for all of secondary, meant something that bonds us all. You were always someone who I admired from a distance, most probably due to you being too 'cool' for me and so good-looking! I remember distinctly beeing invited to your 18th birthday party before our Baccalaureate and loosing my voice as I was singing and shouting and felt honoured to be there and felt so cool to have been part of that day.

    "description": "Piski, I know that every friendship is unique, but my friendship with you was so different to any other in my life. We floated in and out of each others daily lives, meeting up when our paths crossed - in Brussels, Paris, London, New York - picking up wherever we'd left off. We could talk about anything and everything - full trust and no judgement. I loved our rambling conversations - politics, work, love, children... my studies/career in Business and Human Rights blablabla as you called it (the thought of it makes me smile). \n\nI loved your passion - for life, your work, your friends, your family. You lived your life to the absolute fullest. You did and achieved so much. \n\nI loved how much you loved my children and how much they loved their generous, kind, fun, warm hearted Uncle Piski. Ayla running into your room at 7am to ask you to keep playing Monopoly - you, jumping out of bed, totally game, music on, ready to go. You laughing wildly at the 10th time that day that Rafi would say 'no you're poo poo' lol. Ayla talks about you often - I overheard her in the back of the car telling her friend 'my Uncle Piski is so cool...'\n\nI loved your hugs. The best hugs.\n\nI use the word love so much because you were so full of love Piski, and you were so deeply loved in return, by so many. I will always love you. I will keep speaking to you in the quiet moments when I think of you, when I'm missing you, when I want to share something with you. As Ayla would say, we will forever be connected by our invisible string, and you will be held close and dear in our thoughts and our memories.",

Bien que le temps et la distance ait fini par nous √©loigner, aujourd'hui je pleure la disparition d'un fr√®re.\n\nMes plus beaux souvenirs avec toi viennent de notre adolescence, o√π nous √©tions tr√®s proches tous les deux. J'√©tais plus √¢g√© et me sentais parfois responsanble de toi, tu √©tais comme mon \"petit\". M√™me s'il est vrai que tu √©tais plus mature et r√©fl√©chi que la plupart d'entre nous. \n\nEn fait tu avais tout pour toi: tu √©tais le plus sympathique, le meilleur √©l√®ve, tu avais le plus de succ√®s avec les filles... Oui tu √©tais le plus aim√© d'entre nous et tu le m√©ritais tant. Ta pr√©sence nous rendait tous meilleurs dans ces ann√©es si importantes o√π l'on se forme √† la vie.\n\nSi je devais retenir un seul moment avec toi, ou une seule situation plut√¥t, est que pendant tout le lyc√©e nous avons d√©jeun√© ensemble √† la cantine de l'√©cole europ√©enne d'Uccle. Tout les Lundis aux Vendredis, sans faute, et ce pendant des ann√©es. Tous nos potes sortaient de l'√©cole d√®s la pause pour manger un sandwich dehors au mur, mais toi et moi on passait d'abord √† la cantine et on mangeait juste √† deux avant de les rejoindre plus tard. Ce sont ces moments qui ont fait de toi un ami si sp√©cial.  \n\nJ'ai les yeux mouill√©s te revoyant tout jeune devant moi car avec ta disparition, c'est aussi une page de notre propre vie qui se tourne. Tu √©tais un gars en or et tu peux compter sur  nous pour continuer √† faire vivre ta m√©moire.\n\nUn mot aussi pour ta ch√®re famille, pour Elda et Jos√© Sr... Je m'en veux infiniment de n'avoir pas √©t√© plus pr√©sent dans ces derni√®res ann√©es plus difficiles pour Jos√©. Personne ne peut imaginer la douleur que vous ressentez en ce moment et j'esp√®re seulement que de voir et lire tant d'amour pour votre fils vous remette un peu de baume au coeur.\n\nAu revoir, Jos√©.\n\nIssam",

But behind that easy charm was someone incredibly dedicated and driven. He was a top student, and I remember when he self-imposed a friendly competition over our grades. I relished those moments when I‚Äôd score just one percent higher! And yet he was never too proud to ask for help with tricky math homework.\n\nWhen I think of Jos√©, I smile thinking of how he'd jokingly point out which girls were \"future hotties,\" or how he proudly described himself as ‚ÄúAfrican,‚Äù owning his tanned identity with humor.\n\nThe last time we spoke, a couple of years ago, he wasn‚Äôt at all surprised that I‚Äôd ended up in a science-related career. At work, we‚Äôre often reminded to think of the patients behind our daily tasks, to ask ourselves: Who are we working for? Now, I have a clear answer‚ÄîI work for you, Jos√©.\n\nWhenever my work touches on bipolar disorder, you‚Äôll come to mind. There will be a quiet heaviness in my heart, remembering the bright, hard-working, fun-loving person this mental illness took from us. You left us far too soon, but you‚Äôll never be forgotten.

From being in the same class at school, admiring how clever and charismatic this guy was, to sharing a room in Barcelona on that school trip and having special moments there that I can remember with a smile on my face.\nWhat I‚Äôll remember most is when Jos√© helped me with French. He took time to help me with a reading I was quite nervous about in front of class. I‚Äôll never forget it somehow. He was so good to me and just a ray of sunshine in my life especially in my school days. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôll remember him. We connected over basketball too. More recently we‚Äôd go back and forth in messages about the NBA. The last message being a comment on my post about LeBron and Luka playing together in March of this year. Little messages that kept our friendship alive are now even more precious to me. The photo I‚Äôm sharing is from when we spent Thanksgiving together in 2014 in Paris with some other friends from school, a year after I moved here. If I remember right, we were at his studio in Le Marais, my favourite part of the city. Heartbroken to hear about his passing. Sending my condolences to his family and friends.

    "description": "When I came to the European School in primary school, having moved from Devon in England in a whirlwind, I felt completely out of place. To me, the school seemed humongous; Brussels seemed even bigger. The whole thing was overwhelming. I felt so nervous walking into that classroom of strangers; I knew that I wasn't good at making friends.\n\nBut you were the first one to be kind to me, inviting me to sit next to you. You took me under your wing. I immediately felt better.\n\nYou were only 8 years old. But for me, this moment defines you more than anything else you've done. You went on to be beloved by everyone, wise and knowledgeable beyond your years (you were the only one with the intellect to counter Monsieur Piccinin), someone we all knew would take on the world and make a difference. I remember when you made a speech at the European Parliament (I had the very important job of sitting in the booth and operating the power point slides); it felt like you belonged there, on that most important of stages.\n\nThe other defining memory is of our trip to Zambia. You embraced the spirit of that trip more than anyone; something that became clear when you continued to raise money for ZEEC when we were at the University of Warwick. While I was busy having fun, in my own world of drinking games and nights out, you stayed true to the principles we adopted out there in in the Zambezi wilderness‚Äî engaging with the weighty issues of inequality and poverty. \n\nYou offered me a seat at your table, back in primary school; you went on to offer so much more, to so many others, in your time here.\n\nYou will be missed.",

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know of the pain he was going through behind that kind, brave face we knew and loved. His energy and positivity lifted everywhere he graced and everyone he met.

    "description": "My Rufus,\n\nJust a few weeks ago, we promised each other we‚Äôd finally catch up this summer‚Ä¶ \nand now, that moment will never come. \nI still can‚Äôt believe it. It doesn‚Äôt feel real. It hurts in a way words can‚Äôt describe.\n\nYou were truly one of a kind. A light. A burst of joy. Always showing up with that radiant smile, full of life, full of warmth. \nYou had this way of making everyone feel seen, loved, included. \n\nI carry so many memories with you‚Äîat school, on the tennis courts at the L√©o, during school trips, at parties‚Ä¶ \nYou were part of my story. Of our story. \n\nAnd even though time and life created some distance, your presence always stayed in my heart.\n\nWhat breaks me is thinking about the pain you must have been carrying behind that smile. That invisible weight you bore, while still giving your all to everyone around you. \n\nIt‚Äôs unbearable to imagine. You had so much courage, Rufus. \nToo much for one soul alone.\n\nYour friendship was a gift‚Äîso rare, so pure. And now that you‚Äôre gone, I realize even more just how precious and irreplaceable you are. \nThere‚Äôs a silence now where your laughter used to be. A space no one else can fill!\n\nI wish I could go back. Just once. To hug you. To look at you in the eyes and tell you how much you matter to me. To all of us.\n\nI miss you. Deeply. No words will ever be strong enough to express the love, the sadness, the gratitude, and the loss. You will live on in every memory, every story, every corner of our hearts.\n\nI truly hope that wherever you are now, you‚Äôve found peace, the peace you deserved so deeply. I know you‚Äôll keep watching over us, just like you've always done, with love and light.\n\nMy heart goes out to your parents and your family. I can‚Äôt imagine their grief. I wish them endless strength, love, and the courage to carry this pain. They raised someone extraordinary !\n\nI love you, Rufus.\nForever in my heart.\nTatsssss",

You showed so much care and love for others, and you managed to touch so many people during your too short life. I admired your drive, passion and dedication for social justice and for achieving your goals in life. I am forever grateful for the special moments we had together both at the European school in Brussels, at Warwick uni and in London. You were so much fun and such a wonderful friend, a great entertainer and dancer, and so intelligent and hard working all at the same time. I remember the fundraisers you succesfully organised both at the European school and at Warwick University for different social causes to support children and young people living in situations of poverty and hardship. You made this place a better world in so many ways, and it is a big loss for humanity to no longer have you with us. Will try my best to keep your spirit alive. Thank you for everything you gave me and all of us. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. Love, Marie",

I'm sorry we couldn't do more for you, but we will never, ever forget you. I will forever long for talks, dinners, picnics, walks and new memories with you. I hope you have finally found peace, and are somewhere that is filled with joy and all the Latikas you wanted. We love you Jose ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî",

One of the best years of my life was punctuated by his fizzy and fabulous energy. 16 wonderful years of friendship with a true individual and a singularly generous and kind soul.

No nos conoc√≠amos a√∫n pero hab√≠amos o√≠do hablar el uno del otro en Bruselas; sab√≠amos que ambos √≠bamos a Warwick.\n\nYo acababa de llegar con mis padres, a Arthur Vick, nuestra residencia. Comenzaba la 'orientation week'. Estaba desempaquetando mis cosas, instal√°ndome.\n\nDe repente alguien abri√≥ la puerta del pasillo. Eras t√∫, con tu tez morena, con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja, unas cervezas y seguido por un grupo de casi diez chavales y chavalas. Primer d√≠a y parec√≠a que llevabas ah√≠ un mes. Me saludaste, acojedor. No recuerdo lo que nos dijimos, pero recuerdo, recordamos, la impresi√≥n que nos dejaste, a mis padres y a mi. Creo que no hab√≠a conocido a nadie con tal liderazgo natural, con tal espontaneidad, con tal alegr√≠a.\n\nFuiste un pilar en el gran grupo que formamos durante nuestro primer a√±o. Y en seguida pudimos ver que tu alegr√≠a y espontaneidad iba acompa√±ada de generosidad, inteligencia y talento en los estudios.\n\nSiento que no hayamos intercambiado m√°s estos √∫ltimos a√±os (tu nunca fallabas a felicitarme el cumple, yo en cambio...). Te deb√≠a una conversaci√≥n para hablar de nuestros trabajos respectivos en el mundo del GIS, al que hab√≠amos llegado ambos por v√≠as bien distintas.\n\nUn abrazo fuerte Jos√©. Descansa.\nOlmo",

I'll cherish forever memories of crashing on your floor on campus, dancing until stupid hours of the morning, pretending to study in the library, playing Fifa at my flat and you inviting 20 members of your family to graduation. In London the next year, we were unleashed and bossed our Masters, and you were there waiting outside to give me that characteristic bear hug on my graduation day. \n\nFrom there we always made time for each other, catching up globally in Belgium, India and Italy. You encouraged and comforted me dearly when my longest relationship ended and were there encouraging me in person before having my first date after. In recent years, talking about our struggles bonded us and having a proper in face catchup rather than over the phone or facetime after a while will be a memory I'll hold on tight to forever. \n\nSo many of the things I am proud of is because of my friendship and brotherhood with you. I love you brother and will miss your smile and voice x",

We were enchanted by his energy, intellect and kind personality. We  kept in touch during his further education; and he would come back to us, so we could make him his favourite drink at our place: banana milkshake.\nThree years ago on Tenerife was, as it turned out to be now; our last meeting. That was, as ever, a fine catch up as if time hadn‚Äôt passed. He was energetic as always.\nPim and I are shocked by his passing and will think of him in loving memory.\n\nKarin and Pim van Ballekom",

    "description": "Jos√©, it‚Äôs Burny. We were fortunate enough to meet all those years ago back at Warwick, living young and free lives and thick as thieves, especially in final year. Fast forward and our paths crossed again, over in Sydney where our friendship was rekindled, and we enjoyed many a meal, hike, weekend away and cookies‚Ä¶and you‚Äôd sleep in the sunshine whilst I swam in the sea. I could only get you in there once due to your fear of sharks in Australia. It was ever so hard to be in the same place as you thereafter, but a couple of London meets, and you idolising my children, filled my heart enough. Your smile lit up a room, and I‚Äôve never known anyone who could be so silly, yet so hyper intelligent and intellectual at the switch of a button. Your warmth, generosity, loyalty, humour, openness and playfulness is what touches so many, in all corners of the globe that you‚Äôve at one time called home. Your network is so vast, but you‚Äôve often been the common thread that has linked me with others. The world was better because of you. Because of your love and your heart, because you were so good inside, and I‚Äôm going to miss this so dearly. It feels like eternity ago to be young and stupid with little agenda together and the years have rolled on‚Ä¶but not by enough. I will tell your nephew and niece (as you referred my kids) all about you, and if I can provide them as much love, and laughs as you gave others, I think I‚Äôll be doing just fine. Rest easy my brother, I love you. Burny",

    "description": "Jose my brother, you had a true heart of gold. You walked into rooms and lit them up. You always stayed true to yourself, showed relentless empathy and shined your warm energy on every person single you met. \n\nWe were just young rambunctious boys when we met at the European school 27 years ago and we instantly clicked on day one. It always felt like we were blood related, almost like cousins: a reassuring feeling of familiarity. I know this is an exact feeling that many others shared with you -- this was your super power: you made people feel right at home with you, a safe and warm space. \n\nYou very quickly you became the magnet that pulled different social circles together.\nYou were always the life of the party: big smiles, big hugs and big laughs. People were drawn by your charm, charisma and beaming energy. From the early days of eating tortillas at your house, seeing you win tennis championships, doing shabbat dinners at my house, late night shenanigans with the homies, the ski trips, Costa Rica, Tenerife etc All these countless life-changing experiences we shared that molded us into the men that we are today  -- I'm so proud and grateful to have been your close friend and shared this journey with you. \n\nYour talents and potential were immeasurable. You traveled the world, committed yourself to helping those in need, quickly rose to the highest levels of global diplomacy at such a young age. From the door man to the president of any country; you treated everyone with the same respect, built bridges and cared so deeply about those around you, regardless of gender, age or race. You were a force of nature and thousands of people across the world have been impacted by your passion, personality and work. We are all so proud of what you became. \n\nI'm so grateful we got to spend a few beautiful days together in Miami earlier this year with the kids who were insanely obsessed with \"uncle Fruit\". They still ask about you regularly. I still see and feel you in my house and know you're shining your light on us. \n\nEven though we didn't physically spend enough time together in recent years, we both knew we were always a quick call away; your presence and love was as always felt. It always broke my heart hearing about your difficult chapters and feeling so helpless. We always only saw your bright side but I just wish we could've done more to help you and can't imagine the pain and darkness you were going through. Despite these hard times, you still showed up for your friends and loved ones -- you always gave much more than you took. Jose is the definitely of a real mensch. \n\nMay your beautiful soul finally rest in peace my brother, you were forever be loved and missed. \n\nTo the Luengo-Cabrera family: words cannot describe the pain and suffering you must be going through. You should have immense pride in knowing that you created and raised an an incredible son that was deeply loved, cherished and respected by so many around the world. The 100+ notes in this book are just a tiny peek into all the lives Jose touched and the monumental love we all had for him. We truly hope this book helps shine a light on the wonderful memories and the incredible impact Jose had on everyone.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è ◊ë◊®◊ï◊ö ◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ê◊û◊™\nJohn-David K",

Later, we both moved to Paris, and that‚Äôs when I really got to know him. Fruity would always call himself my African brother. He was so sharp, so straightforward, and I absolutely loved his accent.\nThe last time I saw him in person, on a boat in Paris - still lingers with me. I hold onto memories of the three of us; me, him, and Anneliese, hanging out in his apartment, exploring the Parisian nightlife. I guess I always sensed a certain disconnect beneath his happy energy, but that was just Fruity to me. It was part of what made him so unique. The mystery behind the boy. \nWhen I found out, my heart broke. The tears wouldn‚Äôt stop. I couldn‚Äôt make sense of it. I thought of his boys, who are here now, lovingly putting this together for him.\nMeu querido amigo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gone, but clearly not forgotten. Many of us hadn‚Äôt spoken in years, and here you are, bringing us back into each other‚Äôs lives, giving us a reason to reconnect, to reflect, and to remember. That‚Äôs the kind of presence you had.
