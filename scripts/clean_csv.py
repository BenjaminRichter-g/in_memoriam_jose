"""
Clean and transform Jose's Album CSV data for the memorial website.

This script:
1. Removes timestamp and email columns
2. Renames "What's your name?" to "name"
3. Renames "Do you have a personal note..." to "text"
4. Splits multiple image links into separate rows (text only on first row)
5. Removes rows where website permission is "No"
6. Outputs clean CSV for the memorial website converter
